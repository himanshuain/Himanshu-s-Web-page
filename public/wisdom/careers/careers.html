			<h3>If you knew then what you know now, how would you go about finding fulfilling work and ensuring success in your career?</h3>

<p>Choosing the right career path was no trivial matter for Harvard Business School's Class of 1963. They were members of one of the last generations that considered a lifelong career with a company as nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>That’s a stark contrast to the results of a 35-year study conducted by Chuck Pierret, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. His report, released in 2010, found that the average American entering the workforce in 1979 held nearly 11 different jobs by the time she was 42 years old.</p>

<p>So the stakes were much higher when those Harvard grads hit the bricks. They needed to find a job they could live with for a very long time. And a few of them learned, in retrospect, that what they thought would be a rewarding career sometimes turned out to be a mismatch for their true passions. </p>

<p>Today there is clearly less pressure to get it right the first time.  But the advice of the Class of 1963 still has merit for those who’d rather not flounder or waste precious time on a less-than-thoughtful career choice. Do not consult us, they collectively say. "Listen to your heart."</p>

			<p>If you see yourself as an entrepreneur, start your company as soon as you possibly can. If you know the field you want to work in but aren’t sure about your business plan, go to work for a company that you admire in the same type of business you want to create. If you go this route, do not be concerned about compensation.

synonymous, but they’re not opposites, either. Loving what you’re doing (well)
can be infectious and motivating to others. Ultimately, that’s leadership.</p>

			<p>Work is not always fulfilling. That is why we call it work. But if, at the end of a year or five years, you can identify concrete examples of changes you have made that have improved your company or the careers of your employees, I think that is fulfilling.</p><p>In the middle 1950s, when I graduated from high school, the United States was producing 50 percent of the world’s GNP. It was the world’s factory for sophisticated goods — autos, trucks, farm machinery, appliances, railroad equipment, machine tools, and industrial equipment of all kinds. General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were world giants. Most of the factories were in the “industrial heartland” of the country, including my home state of Ohio. I went to the Harvard Business School thinking I wanted to be an executive in a manufacturing company.</p><p>After 10 years of slogging, I left manufacturing for an agribusiness and natural resources company. Being repotted was a success. I enjoyed being the CEO and building the new company.</p><p>In hindsight, I realize the lack of real opportunity in my early career was not due to any mistakes I made or to company politics. It was because the opportunities in a declining industry are so constrained, especially compared to an industry that is growing rapidly. With declining growth, companies and their executives become defensive. They do not take risks, and they focus on preserving the status quo.</p>

			<p>You have the talent and capability to create a great life for yourself and for our society. The opportunities are numerous. The need for leadership is compelling. You live only once, and life is short. So your choices matter greatly.</p><p>Don’t waste your chance to make important contributions. Work on important opportunities and problems. Be an ethical exemplar and committed leader. Become a recognized expert in your chosen profession. Reach out to and concentrate your time with the best people in your profession. Avoid those who are OK or less on values, character, and ethics.</p><p>Choose a career you really enjoy. You’ll make ample money doing work you like with people you admire. You’ll be able to provide your family with everything of real value, so why give up joy for dough?</p><p>Find a firm that understands the real value of good ethics.</p><p>You may consider starting your own company, ideally with one or more friends you trust and admire. If anyone can talk you out of it, let them — because it’s only when you know you must do it that you’ll have the determination to overcome all the obstacles and challenges and have the persistence to figure it out and make it fly.</p><p>If you decide to go ahead, give it all you’ve got. Building your own company is the greatest freedom you can ever have — and it’s fun!</p>			<span class="meta"><a href="charley-ellis/"><span class="disqus-comment-count" data-disqus-id="/careers/charley-ellis/">0 Comments</span> &amp; 44 Likes</a></span>

			<p>Steps to find fulfilling work:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take the initiative to investigate the places you think are of interest. Ask good questions.<br>
</li>
	<li>Go with the self-assurance of having written on an index card each of your past accomplishments (including where you simply helped other people do their thing) in three forms:<br>
<ol class="alpha">
<li>A simple phrase; e.g., “top salesman in New York office for three years”</li>
<li>A three-sentence statement of the problem, your solution, and the result</li>
<li>A one-page explanation or anecdote to share if asked to give details</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use those cards deftly to encourage people to talk to you — showing you listen on their level and understand whatever they tell you. Remember: The more they talk, the smarter they’ll think you are.</li>
</ol>

			<p>Selecting your first job after an MBA graduation is extremely important.&nbsp; Take the time to determine if that first job will provide lots of opportunity to take advantage of your strengths and interests, and will provide the upside that you are looking for. (A Harvard MBA is a precious commodity, and one should take full advantage of it.)</p>

			<p>To greatly enhance the odds of enjoying a career which is both fulfilling and successful, one must find an endeavor, a subject, métier, process, environment for which one has a <i>passion</i>. This could be aviation, geology, medical science, investing, writing fiction, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>In my case, it was a love of markets and investing that my father inculcated in me very early on. This passion has led me to often declare, “I have never <i>worked</i> a day in my life.”</p>			<span class="meta"><a href="charles-hale/"><span class="disqus-comment-count" data-disqus-id="/careers/charles-hale/">0 Comments</span> &amp; 8 Likes</a></span>
